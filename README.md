# Personal Dashboard Application

## Overview

This project is a simple personal dashboard application built using ReactJS. It fetches current weather information and top news headlines using APIs and displays them in a clean, responsive layout.

## Features

- Weather Widget: Displays current weather information including temperature, weather conditions, and an icon representing the weather.
- News Headlines Widget: Shows the top 5 headlines from a chosen country, each displaying title, source, and publish date. Clicking a headline opens the source article in a new tab.
- Responsive Design: Ensures the application works well on both desktop and mobile screens.
- Error Handling: Basic error handling for API requests to gracefully manage failed data fetching.
- State Management: Uses React's useState and useEffect hooks for managing component state and fetching data asynchronously.

## APIs Used

- OpenWeatherMap API: Fetches current weather data.
- NewsAPI (or preferred news API): Fetches top news headlines.
